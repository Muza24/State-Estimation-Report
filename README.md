This paper reviews the literature on state estimation (SE) in power systems. While covering works related to SE in transmission systems, the focus of this paper is to review the method of implementing it in the distribution network. The critical topics of distribution systems SE (DSSE), the different state estimation methods, data driven modelling, and cyber â€“ security are discussed. The conventional and recent approaches, including bad data detection and state estimation (SE) based on different kinds of neural networks, have been reviewed. This paper can give a crisp idea about recent achievements, research gaps and future research paths of state estimation in power systems.
